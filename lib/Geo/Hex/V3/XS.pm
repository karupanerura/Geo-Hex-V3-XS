=head1 NAME

Geo::Hex::V3::XS - GeoHex implementation with XS. (c-geohex3 Perl5 binding.)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Geo::Hex::V3::XS;

    my $zone = Geo::Hex::V3::XS->new(code => 'XM488276746');

    # or

    my $zone = Geo::Hex::V3::XS->new(lat => 35.579826, lng => 139.654524, level => 9);

    say 'geohex.code:  ', $zone->code;
    say 'geohex.lat:   ', $zone->lat;
    say 'geohex.lng:   ', $zone->lng;
    say 'geohex.level: ', $zone->level;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geo::Hex::V3::XS is L<GeoHex|http://geohex.net/> implementation.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<my $geohex_code = encode_geohex($lat, $lng, $level)>

Convert location,level to geohex's code.

=item C<my ($lat, $lng, $code) = decode_geohex($geohex_code)>

Convert geohex's code to location,level.
This location is center of geohex.

=item C<my $size = geohex_hexsize($level)>

Calculate geohex hex size by level.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<my $zone = Geo::Hex::V3::XS-E<gt>new(...)>

Create geohex zone object.

Arguments can be:

=over

=item * C<code>

Create geohex zone object from geohex code.

    use Geo::Hex::V3::XS;

    my $zone = Geo::Hex::V3::XS->new(code => 'XM488548');

=item * C<lat/lng/level>

Create geohex zone object from location with level.

    use Geo::Hex::V3::XS;

    my $zone = Geo::Hex::V3::XS->new(
        lat   => 40.5814792855475,
        lng   => 134.296601127877,
        level => 7,
    );

=back

=item C<$zone-E<gt>lat>

Get geohex center location latitude.

=item C<$zone-E<gt>lng>

Get geohex center location longitude.

=item C<$zone-E<gt>code>

Get geohex code.

=item C<$zone-E<gt>level>
